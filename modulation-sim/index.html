				The demo above shows three waveforms. From top to bottom, they are coloured blue, red
				and purple, and are mathematically described by the following equations
			</p>

			\[ y_1 = \sin{(2\pi f_1 t)} \]
			\[ y_2 = 1 + A_2\cos{(2\pi f_2 t)} \]
			\[ y_{1\times2} = y_1 \times y_2 = \sin{(2\pi f_1 t)} \left(1 + A_2\cos{(2\pi f_2 t)}\right) \]

			<p>
				where \( f1 \) and \( f2 \) are the frequencies of each wave, \( A_2 \) is the amplitude
				of the second wave, and
				\( t \) is the time. The amplitude of the first wave is 1.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can check the "Sound on/off" checkbox to hear what \( y_{1\times2} \) sounds like
				(this feature may not work in older browsers or Internet Explorer). You should be able
				to hear a note that has a frequency of \( f_1 \), that is going up and down in loudness
				at a rate of \( f_2 \). For example, if the value of \( f_2 \) is 1Hz, the volume should
				go to zero once every second.
			</p>

			<p>
				The \( y_2\) waveform is acting as a modulator and creates an amplitude envelope. This
				means its magnitude is determining the magnitude of \( y_{1\times2} \). When the value
				of \( A_2 \) is zero, the modulator has a constant value of 1, and the line \(
				y_{1\times2} \) is exactly equal to \( y_1 \) meaning you will not hear any variation in
				loudness.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you increase \( f_2 \) higher and higher, you may begin to hear two discernible
				frequencies, and the tone sounds a little like a dial tone. This can be explained by
				understanding that the trigonometric identity
			</p>

			\[ \sin{\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)}\cos{\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{2}
			\left[\sin{(x)} + \sin{(y)}\right] \]

			<p>
				allows us to write the equation for \( y_{1\times2} \) as a sum of sine waves, which is
				equivalent to playing two tones of different frequencies.
			</p>
